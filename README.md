# information-website(college magazine)
1.A college information site where you can see webpages describing activities happening inside the campus for the students which may be further split into academic and cultural. 

2.The site might also contain a special page for the alumni who wish to stay updated on campus activities or staff. (Note that it is different from an official college website. Here it is one-way communication to the browser letting him know the information, more like a bulletin board)
